          <h2>Baguio City</h2>
          <p>Hailed as the Summer Capital of the Philippines, Baguio is the top destination to go to if you want to take
            a break from the tropical heat in the lowlands. With average temperatures ranging from 15-23°C, the city
            rarely experiences temperatures higher than 26°C even during the warmest parts of the year. Because of this
            climate, Baguio is also home to beautiful plants that wouldn’t usually survive elsewhere in the county. Also
            nicknamed the City of Pines, you’ll be in for a treat with all the beautiful flowers and lush vegetation as
            you enter the vicinity. It will truly feel as if you’re entering a different world.</p>

          <br>
          <h2>Ifugao</h2>
          <p>When visiting Ifugao, make sure to get a taste of their famous Tinawon rice. While searching for rice keep
            an eye out for the bulul. It is a carved wooden figure used to guard their rice crops. If you haven’t had
            enough of rice yet, visit UNESCO cultural landscapes, the Rice Terraces of the Philippines and scale the
            2,000 year old Banaue Rice Terraces carved into the mountains by Ifugaos. Cap off your trip by attending
            festivals, Gotad Ad Ifugao, held every June to showcase their age old cultures and traditions; where one can
            participate in the traditional wooden scooter race.</p>

            natural and heritage attractions and cultural activities like red clay pottery, grape picking, loom weaving,
            churches for pilgrimage tours, waterfalls, and eco-tours. Discover what else La Union has to offer and stay
            for more than a quick weekend.</p>

          <h2>Ilocos Sur</h2>
          <p>In Ilocos Sur, you’ll be delighted to step into the picturesque Vigan, a UNESCO World Heritage site. It

            While walking in the streets, don’t forget to grab delicacies that are unique to the town such as Vigan
            longganisa and Ilocos empanada.</p>

            lively streets teeming with cars, buildings, and people with high energy, but you’ll also never run out of

          <h2>Puerto Princesa</h2>
          <p>Visit the capital of Palawan, home of the UNESCO World Heritage site and famed Underground River. Travelers
            will have to pass through here when heading for other popular Palawan destinations such as El Nido and
            Coron. However, there’s more than meets the eye in The City in a Forest. You’ll be surprised to find out
            that Puerto Princesa has natural and cultural wonders to offer for different kinds of travelers as well.
          </p>

          <br>
          <h2>Coron</h2>
          <p>Coron is one of Palawan’s most popular beach and island destinations. This paradise-like getaway comprises
            of the eastern half of Busuanga Island, Coron Island, and 50 other islets within the vicinity, all of which
            are separate from the main Palawan island. It has caught the attention of many due to its World War II wreck
            diving spots, beautiful rock formations, and unbelievably clear waters. It is also considered the more quiet
            and laidback sibling of El Nido, another famous Palawan destination because of its gorgeous waters and
            scenery. Coron certainly has a unique charm to it and worth adding to your travel bucket list when in the
            Philippines.</p>
          <img src="Fimg/coron.png" alt="Coron" class="content-image" id="Coron">

          <h2>Boracay</h2>
          <p>Being the Philippines’ top tourist draw and most famous beach took its toll on the island of Boracay. After
            taking a break for 6 months, Boracay reopens greener than ever—and everything is pristine like never before.
            Learn more about the new Boracay and be prepared to fall in love all over again. With glorious White Beach
            and the country's best island nightlife on its resume, it's easy to understand why Boracay is the
            Philippines' top tourist draw. Alas, the tiny island proved too popular for its own good: In 2018 Boracay
            was placed in "rehab," closed for 6 months to ease the strain on its fragile environment and fix the
            infrastructure and carrying capacity.</p>
